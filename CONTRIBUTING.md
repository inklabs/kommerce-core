# How to contribute

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit conforms to the PSR-2 coding standard.
* Make sure your commit messages are well defined.
* Make sure you have added the necessary unit tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/inklabs/kommerce-core).
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request.
* After feedback has been given we expect a response from you within two weeks. After two
  weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
